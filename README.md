PaymentKit-Droid
================

PaymentKit-Droid is an Open Source Android library that allows developers to create sleek payment forms like those made
popular by StubHub, Stripe, Uber, and Postmates. The library provides support for as far back as 2.1.

The PKExample provides an example implementation pattern you may follow.

Right now you'll need to add this project as a submodule project to Android Studio.
